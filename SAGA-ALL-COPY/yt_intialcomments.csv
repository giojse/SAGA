"This song won't be forgotten, no matter how many times I listen to it , it will never get old"
the “you ooh ooh ooh you ooh ooh ooh” part randomly popped in my head and here i am.
More than 2B views!?... oh seems like I am not the only one who wanted to go back to the summer of 2016.
It’s crazy how many people in 2022 will return to listen this legendary song 🔥🏆
"It's May 2022, let's see how many legends are still listening to this masterpiece!💙"
i am brazilian and i love american music i love america i love united states i love you my dream is to become one of you ❤️🇧🇷
I remember hearing this song every day at a summer camp in 2016. It’s crazy how that happened almost 6 years ago. Good memories and fun times! 😊
"This song never gets old. No matter how much I listen, I never get bored"
How is this almost 5 years old already?!
Rihanna is so versatile...the music industry is not the same without her.
The fact that this song has been put almost 6 years and I have been listening to it almost everyday since it came out……. That’s how good this song is
"Más De 5 Años Y Sigue Siendo Una Obra De Arte, Simplemente Genial."
Essa música trás uma vibe inexplicável!!! Música lendária🔥🔥
"this song never gets old, i still cant stop listening to it"
não acredito que essa música virou trend no tiktok
Sem explicação para essa mulher!!! Músicas perfeitas ❤
Esse momento é lindo demais
Today. I'm back here to listen to this great tune again. I love this song
"Pode passar tempos e mais tempos, mas eu nunca irei esquecer e nem parar de ouvir essa música. Sério, irei sempre escutar como se fosse a primeira vez. 😍😍💝💝💝💝💝"
"Calvin harris y rihanna, se complemetan demasiado ,ellos nunca decepcionan,tema que sacan la Rompen .🔥🔥"
